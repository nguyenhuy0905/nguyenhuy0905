- 👋 Hi, I’m @nguyenhuy0905
- 👀 I’m interested in problem solving, and learning stuff in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C. Learning GTK right now. After I have done some simple GTK apps, maybe I will learn SQL and/or libcurl to make more complicated apps to fetch and store data from the internet.
- 💞️ Maybe I will make some clients to not have to use the web browser. Too many distracting things on there.
- 📫 How to reach me: I will set up my social media later. Too lazy.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: nothing fun here
